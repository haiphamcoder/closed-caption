1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking for a place where I can go

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These got their hive, moles got their hole

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking for a place for me to go

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My paws are aching because I've been walking

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen one million trees

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well trees belong in the forest

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But where's the place for me?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow, huh?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said ow.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It got you guys!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for catching us.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We totally would have died.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really died.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's nothing.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm grisby the way.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm Panda.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe it survived that.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were amazing, man.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way you came in, like, whoosh, bam!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you were like, pow!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then, like, just, just, just, just, oh!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I was like, and I was like, uh, uh, uh.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, I was not like that.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, we'll make a great game.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait a second.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something... something's coming to me.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I just got a crazy idea.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if we kept this team thing going?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, like, we stick together.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have each other's backs.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take care of each other.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, a family?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, exactly.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, make us brothers.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we don't even look alike.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's like, the best part.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I guess it is.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cool.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know how brothers.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the problem with the three of us are brothers.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My life!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No matter what happens, we'll always be there for each other.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and to put each other.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Roach for life on three.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One, two, three.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Roach for life.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo-hoo!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick me!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a good one.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're looking out for your life.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm cute too.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a high-ball, all our jammin'.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick me!

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick me!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, here!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, here!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick me!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a pain!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dang it.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lost another one.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just don't get it.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought it was coming to this adoption store and help us find a home for sure.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, guys.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time to call the night.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good time, staff.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like we practice.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bro.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's suit up.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All we're gonna do is wait.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's strange for the last ones.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo-hoo!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There he is!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ran up, folks.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step right up.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come see the adorable bears for sale.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just 25 cents.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For free even.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever fits in your budget.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, bro.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time to step up our game.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do a cute pose, PanPan.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pee!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A durable.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you little bro.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, so adorable.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll make you a deal.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can stay if you help bringing customers.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, just until someone wins us, right?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying to get a doctor.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do it.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do something to win this.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna do something to win this.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can elsewhere.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna � it.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, let me pick up the symbols.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is like...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say it like that.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta push them.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta push them mock.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanna lift it, right?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
của president!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna build up and do something.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to stuff out there.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Lewis.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta make sure it's fresh beauty.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, let's show these nice people what real fun looks like.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is rigged!

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, bro.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go elsewhere.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There you go.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now let's blow this bottle stand.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can find Lewis.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've brought him to fire!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, hey, little friend.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be homeless too.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You went in on our dreams?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guys, wake up.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to see this.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are we?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice morning.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I slept really well.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this place isn't so bad.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Iceberg not entirely opposed.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, this place is great.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
New window.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Iceberg has made front door.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boos!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boos!
