1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Looking for a place where I can go

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
These got their hive, moles got their hole

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
Looking for a place for me to go

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,400
My paws are aching because I've been walking

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,400
I've seen one million trees

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Well trees belong in the forest

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,400
But where's the place for me?

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,399
Ow, huh?

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,399
I said ow.

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
It got you guys!

11
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,399
Thanks for catching us.

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,399
We totally would have died.

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,399
I really died.

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
Here's nothing.

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,399
Ow.

16
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,399
I'm grisby the way.

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,399
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,399
I'm Panda.

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
I can't believe it survived that.

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
You were amazing, man.

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,400
The way you came in, like, whoosh, bam!

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
And you were like, pow!

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,400
And then, like, just, just, just, just, oh!

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,400
And I was like, and I was like, uh, uh, uh.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Hey, I was not like that.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Wow, we'll make a great game.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Wait a second.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Something... something's coming to me.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Hold on.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I don't think...

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Okay, I just got a crazy idea.

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
What if we kept this team thing going?

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
What do you mean?

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
You know, like, we stick together.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Have each other's backs.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
And take care of each other.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Like, a family?

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Yeah, exactly.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
And now, make us brothers.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
But we don't even look alike.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I know!

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
That's like, the best part.

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Yeah.

45
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Yeah, I guess it is.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Cool.

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I know how brothers.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Yes!

49
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
What's the problem with the three of us are brothers.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
My life!

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
No matter what happens, we'll always be there for each other.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Yeah, and to put each other.

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
All right.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Roach for life on three.

55
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
One, two, three.

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Roach for life.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Ah!

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Woo-hoo!

59
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Pick me!

60
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm a good one.

61
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
You're looking out for your life.

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm cute too.

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm a high-ball, all our jammin'.

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Pick me!

65
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Pick me!

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Oh, here!

67
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Oh, here!

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Pick me!

69
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm a pain!

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Oh.

71
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Dang it.

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Lost another one.

73
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I just don't get it.

74
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I thought it was coming to this adoption store and help us find a home for sure.

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Huh?

76
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
All right, guys.

77
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Time to call the night.

78
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Good time, staff.

79
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Just like we practice.

80
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, bro.

81
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Let's suit up.

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
All we're gonna do is wait.

83
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,400
That's strange for the last ones.

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
What?

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Woo-hoo!

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
There he is!

87
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Ah!

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Ah!

89
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Ah!

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Ah!

91
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Ah!

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Ah!

93
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Ah!

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Ah!

95
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Ah!

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Ah!

97
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Ah!

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Ah!

99
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Ah!

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You ran up, folks.

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Step right up.

102
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Come see the adorable bears for sale.

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Just 25 cents.

104
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
For free even.

105
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Whatever fits in your budget.

106
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
All right, bro.

107
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Time to step up our game.

108
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Do a cute pose, PanPan.

109
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Pee!

110
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
A durable.

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Now you little bro.

112
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, so adorable.

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I'll make you a deal.

114
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You can stay if you help bringing customers.

115
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, just until someone wins us, right?

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm trying to get a doctor.

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm gonna do it.

118
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm gonna do it.

119
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm gonna do it.

120
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm gonna do it.

121
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm gonna do it.

122
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm gonna do it.

123
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I know someone wins us, right?

124
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm trying to get a doctor.

125
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Huh?

126
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Adopted.

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Oh, yeah, sure, right.

128
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Ok, Lewis.

129
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You got a mic?

130
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
And some fresh beats?

131
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
You know, let's show these nice people what real fun looks like.

132
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Flann!

133
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Busset,我是 Brian Busset.

134
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Christopher Busset.

135
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Kickin' Pan.

136
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Kickin' Pan.

137
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Kickin' Pan!

138
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Go Little Bro!

139
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
GoLittle Bro, GoLittle Bro Go!

140
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Go Little Bro, GoLittle Bro, GoLittle Bro, Go!

141
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Pow!

142
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Ah!

143
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Huh!

144
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Lewis?

145
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
What is this below me?

146
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,719
This is rigged!

147
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,560
Come on, bro.

148
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Let's go elsewhere.

149
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
There you go.

150
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,439
Now let's blow this bottle stand.

151
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,480
You can find Lewis.

152
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
You've brought him to fire!

153
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,639
Oh, hey, little friend.

154
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,160
You must be homeless too.

155
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,480
You went in on our dreams?

156
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,079
Hey.

157
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,639
Oh.

158
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,680
Oh.

159
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Huh?

160
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Guys, wake up.

161
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
You got to see this.

162
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Oh.

163
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Oh.

164
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Where are we?

165
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Nice morning.

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Yeah.

167
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
I slept really well.

168
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,759
And this place isn't so bad.

169
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,240
Iceberg not entirely opposed.

170
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Yeah, this place is great.

171
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
New window.

172
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Iceberg has made front door.

173
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Boos!

174
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Boos!
